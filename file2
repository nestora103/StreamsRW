Those people who think the Daily Mail is a newspaper apart, whether for good or ill, will have their view reinforced by its coverage of the supreme court ruling.

It continued its assault on Britainâ€™s most senior judges. It attempted to assassinate the character of Gina Miller, the woman who sought to ensure that parliament should take the decision on Brexit.

And it prepared to do battle with members of the house of lords who might dare to speak up on behalf of the millions who voted to remain in the European Union.

In so doing, the Mail stands alone. With the exception of the Daily Express, which is politically irrelevant anyway, it casts itself as the lone voice of wisdom and sanity.
