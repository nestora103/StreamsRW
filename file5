What the Mail means, of course, is that its own interpretation of the referendum result should hold sway. It is convinced that the voters wanted a complete break with the EU - no relationship whatsoever with the single market and no membership of the customs union.

The worst aspect of its editorial was not its attack on the judges but on Miller, the woman who dared to launch the action. She was, said the Mail, “the gloating Guyana-born investment manager who alternates between glorying in self-promotion and complaining that her safety is under threat.”

Is her safety improved by such remarks? And is it improved by its profile headlined What’s the truth about Gina? It couldn’t find any mud, but its article was laced with innuendo.

Then the Mail is moved on to its favourite targets: politicians. It is unworried by the Commons but is concerned about the Lords, “with its huge inbuilt majority of Remoaners.”

The Express also laid into “the anti-democratic Remoaners” but believes peers, “despite overwhelmingly supporting the Brussels regime, will hopefully recognise the dangers of using their unelected positions to thwart the will of the people.”
