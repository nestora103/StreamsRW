The Sun, which took a swipe at Miller while exonerating the judges, clearly believes the judgment will make no difference: Theresa May looks likely to snatch victory from the jaws of her supreme court defeat.

And the Daily Telegraph agreed. It did not see the ruling as “a resounding victory” for “diehard Remainers”. The government will still be able to trigger article 50 by the end of March.

As for the Times, it thought the supreme court’s judgment was “rooted in a longstanding constitutional tradition.” The judges had ensured that parliament remained sovereign. The Daily Mirror echoed that opinion.

And the Financial Times took a similar view, seeing the decision as “the most significant constitutional judgment for a generation” and “a triumph for Britain’s judicial system and the supreme court”.

It scorned the Mail’s view of the judges as “enemies of the people”: an argument “so grotesquely at odds with the facts and with the law that only a profound cynic, or a great fool, would profess it.”

The Guardian, in arguing that the supreme court “spoke for Britain”, also had a word of praise for Miller and her co-plaintiffs as “the heroes, not the villains, in this story”.

So the Mail alone - or its editor, Paul Dacre, alone - could not see the supreme court ruling for what it was: a confirmation that the law is the law and that the separation of powers enhances our democracy.
